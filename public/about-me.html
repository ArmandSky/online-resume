<h1>About Me</h1>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<p>I am by nature a very calm person, I enjoy nature & animals, I have 1 dog and 3 cats. They are my best friends.
    I enjoy playing video games however with life being so busy, I don't always get the chance to do so as in the past.
I am someone that always love doing new things or to learn myself new skills, in my family we have a mindset of always striving
 to learn and grow ourselfs in all aspects of life. I love sports especially rugby, my favorite team is the Blue Bulls &
 I always want to go and watch them play. I am a goal orientated person and also value traditional values such as Integrity,Honor,Honesty
 and doing something to the best of my abilities.

<p>It is never easy to write about yourself and on my main page I have written about my strengths and summary about that, 
    I would say one thing that I am not as good in or might say is one of my weaknesses, I am someone that is very passionate about my work and when
    I get stuck into a project, I sometimes get very caught up in the work to do as good as a job as I can that I don't always
    remember to communicate my progress as I should, which is a trait that I have gotten much better in since I noticed this,
    and something I strive to continuesly grow and improve myself in.
