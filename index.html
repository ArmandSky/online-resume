    <h2>Summary:</h2>
   <div>
    <p>I am a 25 year old Software Developer who studied a  Bachelor of Information(BIT) degree at Belgium Campus. 
        I have extensive skills in all areas of Technology. I have always had an affinity for Computers and everything technology related
        I have a great drive to better myself and to gain greater understanding and knowledge about my field. I started building custom Computers at the age of 8 and have a great knowledge base around Computers and Computer hardware.
        I worked for several years as a Part-Time Salesperson for the Portchie Art Gallery in Pretoria, which helped grow my interpersonal skills among co-workers as well as clients in a high intensity environment.
        I have also for the past several years during my University period learned how to work and operate 3d printers and 3d printing software and design. I am currently in the process of running a small entrepreneurial 3d printing business.
        I have 3 years of practical as well as theoretical software Development experience through my time at Belgium Campus University.
        I either worked or studied in the following languages: C#, C++, JavaScript, Java, PHP, HTML5+, SQL ,NoSQL, Python, R, CSS.
        I achieved top honors at University level by placing 3rd in the Top 3 students for both my first (2020) & second (2021) academic Years at Belgium Campus University for the bachelor of Information Technology degree (BIT).  
        During my final year I was employed part time by MJR Marketing Solutions for an intern role until the end of 2022, after which I was employed full time by MJR as a Software Developer and was entrusted and tasked with maintaining a complex system as well as development of new features for the system as well as being part of the entire development life cycle and providing client support as well as database management.
